                    The machine language is sometimes referred to as machine code or object code which is set of binary digits 0 and 1. These binary digits are understood and read by a computer system easily.it considered a native language as it can be directly understood by a central processing unit.

                    The assembly language is considered a low-level language for microprocessor and many other programmable devices.The assembly language is also considered as second generation languange.The first generation languange is machine languange.The assembly languange is mostly famous for writing an operating system and also in desktop application.

                <p >
                    The development of high-level language was done when the programmers face the issue in writing programs as the older language has portability issues which mean the code written in one machine cannot be transferred to other machines.Thus lead to the development of high-level language. The high-level language is easy to understand and the code can be written easily as the programs written are user-friendly in a high-level language.
